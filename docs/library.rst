Widget Library
==============

By now, you have checked out or downloaded the widget library from
`github <https://github.com/elsampsa/cutefront-lib>`_ as was discussed in previous sections.

Basic Widgets
-------------

- ``widget.js`` : the motherclass of all widgets
- Each widget component lives in its own ``.js`` file
- Each widget component has an accompanying ``.html`` file for minimal interactive testing and demonstration of the widget

You can test each of the widgets by simply accessing their test/demo html files and using the "plainfile" development environment
mention in :ref:`here <devenvs>`.

.. warning::

    There is no guarantee that all the widgets and their corresponding html file are up-to-date
    - CuteFront is work in progress
